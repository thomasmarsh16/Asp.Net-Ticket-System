# Introduction

1.1 Purpose
           
The purpose of this software project is to construct a ticket system for tasks that can be shared and completed between multiple people while also giving management the ability to monitor workers current tasks and completion rates.

1.2 Intended Audience/Use

Intended audiences for this document are those who would like to see the reasoning behind how this software project has been implemented. This document can be used to see why some design decision were made and the goals that the project worked toward.

1.3 Scope

The main objective for this software project is to provide a ticket system which can enable monitoring and control of task completion for projects. Project managers will be able to view tasks by project groupings, who is working on certain tasks, and how long tasks have been "checked out". Workers meanwhile will be able to view what tasks they have been assigned, who else is working on the tasks, and other data for tasks.

1.4 Definitions and Acronyms

Risks for this project are those involving schedule conflicts caused by workers being assigned more tasks than they can handle. Another risk for this project is that of server and connection issues causing workers to not be able to use the software.
